We cannot provide the original administrative data due to confidentiality.

**Code:**
*	**1_pre_processing.R.** The code for section 1.3 of the manuscript execute the pre-processing of the 	administrative dataset of the Lombardy region. The covariates necessary for the analyses are created in this 	     dataset. In particular, each purchase of drugs will be assigned the relative DDD and pharmaceutical class. This 	     file outputs the initial dataset with 51 features.

*	**2_sequence_construction.R.** The code for section 3.2 of the manuscript shows how the sequences necessary for the analyses (Combined-sequence, DIU-sequence and AAG-sequence) are constructed. The first phase consists of preparing the longitudinal data to select pharmaceutical purchases in the first year of observation. Then a stratified undersampling is done with respect to the survival outcome to reduce the dataset. The "create_seq.R" function creates binary sequences for the five interest drugs; by aggregating the sequences of RAS, BB and AA the combined sequence is obtained. It is also created using "create_seq_hosp_days.R", the variable that counts the days of hospitalisation in the first year of observation.

*	**3_sequence_analysis.R.** The code for section 3.3 shows the analysis of the constructed sequences. For   each group of sequences (combined, DIU and AAG), the state distribution plot, the sequence frequency plot, the mean time spent in each state and the transition rates between states are shown. Entropy and turbulence and their correlation are also calculated.

*	**4_sequence_clustering.R.** Code for section 3.4 shows the sequence clustering procedure. After calculating         the dissimilarity matrix using the Optimal Matching distances, where the replacement costs derive from the             transition rates, the hierarchical clustering with k = 2, ..., 8 is applied. The best hierarchical clustering           partition is chosen using the quality metrics and is used to initialise the PAM algorithm. Once the final               partition is chosen, using the visualisation tools shown in "3_sequence_analysis.R", the sequences in each             cluster are analysed.

*	**5_final_dataset.** The code for sections 2.3, 2.4 and 3.4.4 produces the final dataset used for the 	predictive models. The construction of the variables representing the patient's comorbidities is shown through the ICD-9-CM / CSS mapping. These variables are used to calculate the Multisource Comorbidity Score for each patient. The information about the clustering of sequences is added to the patient. For each patient, the cluster variable will indicate belonging to the combined-sequence partition; DIU and AAG will indicate whether the patient is a low-adopter/ adopter of the two drugs.

*	**6_logistic_regression.** The code for section 3.5 presents the logistic regression model used to predict 	      whether the death of the patient has occurred within the follow-up time.

*	**7_survival_analysis.R.** The code for section 3.6 presents the survival analysis using Cox's regression           model. The comparison between the two significant clusters of the combined-sequences reported in 3.6.1 of the           manuscript is shown.

**Subfolders:**

**I. Auxiliary_function**:
-	create_seq.R. This function constructs the sequences with states 0 and 1 (No drug / drug) for the 52 weeks of 	  observation.
- 	create_seq_hosp_days.R. This function creates a sequence indicating which days the patient was hospitalised 		in the 365 observation days.
- 	create_coverage_days.R. This function calculates the days of drug coverage in the 365 observation days and 	       will be used for the adherence calculation.

**II. Dataset:**
-	DDD&class_pharm.xlxs. This excel file shows, for each ATC code, the defined daily dose (sheet 1) and the 	     related pharmacological class (sheet 2).
-	data_for_sequences.Rdata. This dataset contains the selected patient cohort and all pharmacological purchases 	  for constructing the sequences.
- 	patients_final_cohort.Rdata. This dataset contains the unique codes of the patients in the final patient 	     cohort.
